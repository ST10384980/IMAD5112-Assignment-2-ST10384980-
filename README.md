Assignment 2

My Tamagotchi app is an application where the users can look after an animated Puppy. Just like a normal puppy users are required to Feed, Clean and Play with the puppy.
The application will welcome users with an adorable Puppy and welcome message and insist that users press the Start Button and then users will be required to see what is required 
to make the puppy Happy. Just remember the moment users press the Start button a Timer will go off and users will be required to Feed, Clean and Play with the application 
before kicks it users back to the welcome page.
